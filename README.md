# StopWatch 1.0

After reading some of Hal Elrod's [The Miracle Morning](https://miraclemorning.com/), I realized that doing a few short timed activities in succession would be much easier and more enjoyable if I could be fully present and didn't have to continually watch a clock, routinely reset a basic timer, or find and repurpose a pomodoro timer. Hence, I built this stopwatch as a learning project and solution to my issue.

_Note: I noticed that Hal offers an app. Frankly, it seems too feature-rich and non-minimalistic for me. All I'm looking for is some automatic support in keeping time._

StopWatch:

- **encourages a focus on how much time as passed in total, rather than how much time is left for an activity**
- **encourages the user to fully immerse in an activity, rather than watching the clock**

## Tech/Frameworks:

JavaScript  
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)  
[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)  
[React](https://react.dev/)  
[react-router-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom)  
[TailwindCss](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## How to Use

- Choose a interval in number of minutes from the number input. If no interval is selected, none will be used.
- Choose a sound to be played each interval from the sound options input. If no sound is selected, none will be played.
- Press "Start".
